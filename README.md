# SCP-TTRPG

The Safeguards have failed. Red Emergency lights flash as you stand in the lobby of the **SCP Foundation**.

**Site19** crumbles at the hands of a catastrophic incursion. Reality itself is at stake.

There for different reasons, your group is now the only hope of stopping the encroachment of **"The Abyssal”**.

The Foundation is a dungeon crawl for **YZE**, Journey into the bowls of Site19, the labyrinthic branch of a multinational organization charged with Securing Containing and Protecting the paranormal. A corrupting Abyssal force has made its way into the halls of the foundation, compromising the organization and threatening the existence of life on Earth.

**The Foundation** has noticed a statistical uptick in paranormal anomalies within Site19. This memo aims to ensure that employees are informed of the dangers.

## **THE ABYSSAL**
SCP Foundation records indicate that the ABYSSAL was initially discovered during the “Hemlock Harbor” Incident. Essentially, it embodies corruption, preying on the unconscious aspects of an individual and gradually distorting them mentally and physically. As a result of the Dimensional fabric weakening, localized occurrences have emerged. The manifestations frequently exhibit a ghastly and translucent appearance, indicating that their forms haven't completely transitioned into our material plane. While the effects vary from person to person, the corruption typically manifests in three distinct humanoid forms: Drones, Brutes, and Ghouls.

The **ABYSSAL** doesn't seem to function as a simple virus. Those corrupted are directed towards a singular objective — disrupting the dimensional wards of SITE19, which, in turn, weakens the our fabric of Reality. Recently these protective fabric wards can be sufficiently weakened and allows entities from beyond our plane of existence to cause a **QUAKE**.

## Q.U.A.K.E. (Quick, Unearthly Agitated, Kinetic, Energy)

Localized occurrences of QUAKE have emerged. The manifestations frequently exhibit a ghastly and translucent appearance, indicating that their forms haven't completely transitioned into our material plane! These **QUAKES** have the potential to crash over to our primary material reality as we know it.

Pinpointing a source and establishing an exact timeline of events has proven challenging due to the rapid spread of the ABYSSAL throughout SITE19 and subsequent breakdown in communication. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that the ABYSSAL’s proliferation originated from Level 10: Trans-Dimensional Research.

These QUAKEs are limited and only last a few moments. Entities beyond our reality WILL attack if provoked. Physical attacks do not cause harm but deal **STRESS DAMAGE** as a mind numbing chill ripples throughout the victim’s psyche. Our research department has found that traditional weapons cannot harm any QUAKE entities but any **PSI (Para Salient Items)** effects may take effect!

## PSIs (Para Salient Items)
PSI, aka Para Salient Items, appear to be ordinary items, yet they harness energy by tapping into alternate dimensions or planes of existence. These PSI often manifest as symbolic representations, resembling icons we attribute significance to, even though they are imitations or distortions in some way. The symbolic nature provides them with a framework and purpose, allowing the contained power to be harnessed and controlled for practical use.

The energy within PSIs is tangible, discernible even by those lacking specific knowledge. Yet, understanding the manner in which this power materializes might necessitate some experimentation. It's crucial to meticulously handle and contain all PSIs, as they seek harmony, and an unattended PSI won't remain undisturbed for an extended period. Provided below are a few examples of PSIs currently under the Foundation’s possession.

- **PSI-2** | A yellow stress ball that activates upon being released form a tight squeeze. Upon activation, the user violently propels 30’ forward in the direction they were facing, dissipating kinetic energy on any solid objects that blocks the path.
- **PSI-4** | A small globe that activates upon being spun counter clockwise by the user. Upon Activation a gravitational force pulls nearby small objects and pieces of debris orbit the user until Deactivated by spinning clockwise.
- **PSI-9** | A pet rock that activates upon skin contact with recently deceased humanoids. Upon activation, the deceased may have an allergic reaction stimulating cancerous tumor that grows under the pet rock until it essentially clones the deceased allowing them to live on in this new host.
