# VECHLE
ABRV | TERM | DESC
|-|-|-|

# CRIT Vehicle Damage
D12| D66 |D6 |DAMAGE |EFFECTS|
|-|-|-|-|-|
1| 11–13 |1| Ricochet |The attack bounces off the vehicle and strikes another random target in the same zone, inflicting the same damage to it.
2 |14–16 |2 |Skid |The vehicle skids severely. The driver must make an immediate skill roll (not an action) – failure means that the driver loses their next turn, and is unable to perform any actions.
3| 21–23| 3 |Windshield Shattered| The windshield of the vehicle is shattered, reducing the Maneuverability of the vehicle one step.
4 |24–26 |4 | Driver Hit |The driver is hit and suffers damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle.
5 |31–33| 5| Passenger Hit |A random passenger is hit and suffers damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle, and a critical injury. Re-roll if no passengers are present.
6 |34–36 |6 |Wheel Blown| A wheel or thruster on the vehicle is blown out, giving a −2 modifier to all driving skill rolls.
7 |41–43| —| Severe Spin |The attack rocks the vehicle. The driver must make an immediate skill roll (not an action) – failure means that the vehicle crashes and is automatically wrecked. Each passenger then suffers D3 points of falling damage (page 24) plus one for each zone of altitude, mitigated by the vehicle’s armor.
8| 44–46 |— |Fuel Fire |The vehicle catches fire. The vehicle and everyone inside is exposed to intensity 6 (C) fire.
9 |51–53 |—| Weapon Disabled| A random weapon mounted on the vehicle is disabled. Re-roll if no weapons are present.
10| 54–56 |— |Massive Crash |The vehicle careens out of control and crashes violently. It is automatically wrecked, and each passenger suffers D6 points of falling damage plus one for each zone of altitude, mitigated by the vehicle’s armor.
11| 61–63 |— |Engine Disabled |The engine is disabled, and the vehicle can’t continue. An aerial vehicle can make a controlled landing, losing one zone of altitude per round.
12 |64–66 |— |Explosion |The vehicle explodes in a ball of flame. Everyone inside is exposed to a blast power 9 (B) explosion, and the vehicle is destroyed beyond repair.

# CHSE (Chase)

D10 |FOOT CHASE | OBSTACLES
|-|-|-|
1 |DEAD END| If the prey has chosen to Pursue/Flee, Hide, or Block, the maneuver fails automatically.
2 |FOOD STALL| A food stall or market stand blocks the way. If the prey has chosen to Flee, Hide, or Block, they must first make a Force roll (no action) to crash through the glass. If it fails, the maneuver is canceled, and the prey suffers D3 points of damage.
3| VEHICLE/CART| A car or cart pulls in and blocks the way. This gives a +2 modifier to Pursue/Flee and Stand and Shoot maneuvers, but −2 to Cut Off.
4 |CROWD| The crowds of people making their way along the street provide cover for the prey. A Hide maneuver gets a +2 modifier, and even if the prey doesn’t Hide, the pursuer must roll Observation (no action). If it fails, their maneuver for the round fails automatically. Any failed Stand and Shoot maneuver means a bystander is hit.
5 |MONKS| A throng of robed, chanting monks blocks the road. The prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to convince them to move. Success gives a +2 modifier to any Hide maneuver. A failed roll means that the prey’s maneuver fails automatically.
6 |GUARDS/POLICE| A pair of guards or police try to block the chase, weapons drawn. This gives a −2 modifier to Pursue/Flee, Hide and Stand and Shoot. Anyone who performs the Stand and Shoot maneuver will be attacked by the guards.
7 |OLD MAN| An old man grabs at the pursuer and starts chattering away, clearly after money. The pursuer must give the man some money or push him away with Force. If it fails, their maneuver for the round fails automatically.
8 |GARBAGE| There is garbage and debris all over the street, making the ground slippery. Any Pursue/Flee maneuvers get a −2 modifier this round, while Block gets +2.
9 |OPEN SPACE| The chasers suddenly find themselves in an open space, the crowds clearing for a moment. This gives a +2 modifier to Stand and Shoot but −2 to Hide.
10 |THUGS| D6 street thugs block the road, threatening violence. The prey must roll Persuasion (no action) to be allowed to pass. A failed roll means that the thugs attack – the chosen maneuver fails automatically and one thug attacks in close combat. If the Persuasion roll succeeds, the thugs will attack the pursuer instead.

## Obstacles

D10 |VEHICLE CHASE |OBSTACLES
|-|-|-|
1 |Dead End| If the prey has chosen to Pursue/Flee, Hide, or Block, the maneuver fails automatically.
2 |Downpour| A sudden downpour makes it difficult to see and the pavement slippery. The Pursue/Flee maneuver gets a disadvantage, but Hide gets an advantage.
3 |Vehicle/Cart| A car or cart pulls in and blocks the way. This gives an advantage to the Block maneuver, but a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee, and any failed such maneuver inflicts D3 points of damage to the driver’s vehicle.
4 |Red Lights| The traffic lights by a pedestrian crossing turn red, and a throng of people cross the street. This gives an advantage to the Cut Off maneuver, but a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee and Stand and Shoot. Any such failed maneuver will result in collateral damage.
5 |Patrol Car| A police patrol car joins the fray, sirens blaring. This gives a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee, Hide, and Stand and Shoot. Anyone who performs the Stand and Shoot maneuver will be fired upon by the police.
6 |Freeway| The vehicles move onto a wide freeway with multiple lanes, the traffic clearing for a moment. This gives an advantage to Pursue/Flee and Stand and Shoot, but a disadvantage to Hide and Block.
7 |Roadworks| A major roadworks is up ahead. It gives an advantage to the Hide, Block, and Cut Off maneuvers, but a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee and Stand and Shoot. A failed Pursue/Flee roll will inflict D3 points of damage to the vehicle.
8 |Cyclists| A group of dozens of cyclists are making their way along the streets, forming a noisy, clanking, almost impenetrable barrier. This gives an advantage to the Block maneuver, but a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee and Stand and Shoot. Any such failed maneuver will result in collateral damage.
9 |Truck| A massive truck blocks the way. This gives an advantage to the Cut Off maneuver, but a disadvantage to Pursue/Flee. A failed Pursue/Flee roll will inflict D6 points of damage to the vehicle.
10 |Alleyway| The chase enters a narrow alley. Passing through unscathed requires a separate skill roll (no action) before any maneuver is resolved – failure means the vehicle is wrecked and the chase is over. The driver can choose to cancel their maneuver and navigate the alley slowly and carefully (no roll required).

## Mounts
---
During travel, you can only ride for two shifts per day. To ride
for a third shift, you need to make a Mobility roll. If you fail,
your mount goes lame and becomes incapacitated. A mount
needs at least one shift of rest per day.

---

|-|-|-|
2 |Broken Axle |The vehicle becomes inoperable, needing a shift of repairs and a successful Crafting roll before it can continue.

4 |Busted Gearbox | The vehicle cannot move any further. Fixing the problem requires a Crafting roll and shift of work.
5 |Dirty Fuel | The engine stops due to dirt or water in the fuel. All of the fuel in the tank needs to be drained and the vehicle refueled before it can continue.

# CAMP
---
D10 |MISHAP| EFFECT
|-|-|-|
1 |Food Spoiled|  Your food has rotted or been infected by insects. Half the rations you are carrying are spoiled.
2 |Flooding | Heavy rainfall (page 42) starts in the middle of the night. The camp is flooded and everything gets soaking wet. All characters must roll for Stamina to resist cold (page 25), and no one gets any sleep.
3 |Fire Dies | The firewood is wet, and your campfire goes out. Except in warm weather, everyone must roll for Stamina to resist cold.
4 |Fire! | The flames from your campfire spread out of control. If you have a tent, it’s destroyed. Each character suffers the effects of fire with intensity D, and must make a Mobility roll to save their gear. Failure means that one piece of equipment (GM’s discretion) is lost in the fire.
5 |Ants  |Your camp sits right in the middle of an ant road. You each suffer one point of stress (damage to Empathy) and no one gets any sleep here.
6 |Lice | A randomly selected character has caught lice. It itches horribly, and they get a rash all over their body. The victim suffers one point of stress (damage to Empathy) each day and cannot sleep this day. A successful Healing roll stops the effect.
7 |Mosquito Swarm  | A large swarm of mosquitoes attacks the camp, driving everyone crazy. Roll two D6 for each character – for each success rolled, the character suffers one point of stress (damage to Empathy).
8 |Savage Animal | A starving wolf, dog, boar or even a bear attacks the camp.
