M3 PERSONNEL ARMOR. Standard issue
for the USCMC, the M3 consists of a rigid armor padded vest, a flexible ballistic pad that covers the abdomen, and clamshell greaves on the lower legs. The armor protects against edged weapons and glancing blows from high powered ammunition. It has a built-in comm unit and Personal Data Transmitter, combat webbing straps to connect a variety of equipment, and contact points which monitor the wearerâ€™s vitals and transmit them to a tactical monitoring station. Armor Rating 6.
