## TLNT Talents
While Attributes and skills outline your general capabilities, talents delineate particular areas of expertise. Talents **TLNT** embody distinctive tricks and specialties, providing you with a competitive advantage and introducing an element of unpredictability for your adversaries. Initially, you typically begin the game with one or a few **TLNT**s, and your options are constrained by your **HSTR** History. However, you can acquire additional specialties during the game without being restricted by your archetype.

TLNT | Talent | Description
|-|-|-|
T-GARD| BodyGuard|If someone within Short range of you is hit by an attack, you can dive in to take the hit. Roll for Mobility. It doesn’t count as an action in combat. If you roll one or more successes, you take the hit instead of your friend. You can push the roll.
T-PASS| Compassion| You can push any skill roll based on Empathy twice, not just once like other characters.
T-RFLX| Fast Reflexes| You can draw two initiative cards instead of one during the initiative draw. Choose the one you want to use.

T-DEXT| Flywight| When you block in close combat, you can use Agility instead of Strength.
T-VIBE| Gut Feeling| You have a knack for sensing when trouble is coming your way. You can roll for Observation using Empathy instead of Wits to detect an approaching threat.
