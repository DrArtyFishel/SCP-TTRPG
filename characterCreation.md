![character-sheet](./employee-tracker.png)

As a player, you determine your PC's (Playable Character) thoughts, emotions, words, and actions – though not their outcomes. Your responsibility is to fully engage with your PC, they are essentially a person with emotions and aspirations, akin to yourself. Endeavor to envision how you would respond in their situation and what actions you would take. The player characters invariably take on the role of protagonists in the narrative, making the game revolve around you – your choices, your adventures. The goal of the game is to make a good story, allow your PC to grow and adapt to the risks and challenges they face.

The GM (Game Master) narrates the details of the game world, embodies the characters you encounter, and directs the adversaries you face. The gameplay unfolds as an ongoing dialogue between the PCs and the GM until a crucial situation arises, introducing uncertainty in the outcome. This is when dice come into play.

The GM's responsibility involves placing obstacles in your characters' path, challenging them, and compelling them to showcase their true abilities. However, it is not the GM's sole prerogative to dictate every event in the game, particularly the conclusion of your story. The unfolding narrative is collectively determined within the game. The essence of playing is dependent on discovering how your story will ultimately unfold.

## TLNT Talents
While Attributes and skills outline your general capabilities, talents delineate particular areas of expertise. Talents **TLNT** embody distinctive tricks and specialties, providing you with a competitive advantage and introducing an element of unpredictability for your adversaries. Initially, you typically begin the game with one or a few **TLNT**s, and your options are constrained by your **HSTR** History. However, you can acquire additional specialties during the game without being restricted by your archetype.

TLNT | Talent | Description
|-|-|-|
GARD| BodyGuard|If someone within Short range of you is hit by an attack, you can dive in to take the hit. Roll for Mobility. It doesn’t count as an action in combat. If you roll one or more successes, you take the hit instead of your friend. You can push the roll.
PASS| Compassion| You can push any skill roll based on Empathy twice, not just once like other characters.
RFLX| Fast Reflexes| You can draw two initiative cards instead of one during the initiative draw. Choose the one you want to use.
DOCT| Field Surgeon| You know the delicate art of stopping a wound from bleeding or treating grave injuries. You get a +1 modifier to Healing when treating someone who is about to die from a critical injury.
DEXT| Flywight| When you block in close combat, you can use Agility instead of Strength.
VIBE| Gut Feeling| You have a knack for sensing when trouble is coming your way. You can roll for Observation using Empathy instead of Wits to detect an approaching threat.
HRDN| Hardened| Your maximum Resolve score is increased by 1. You can take this specialty up to three times.
HTTR| Hard Hitter |You get a +1 modification to Melee Combat if you sacrifice your fast action in the round.
HLER| Healer| You are very resilient and recover quickly from injuries. The healing time of critical injuries is halved for you.
INQU| Inquisitive| You can push any skill roll based on Wits twice, not just once like other characters.
KILR| Killer| You know where to strike to make your enemy fall and not get up. Ever. When your enemy sustains a critical injury you may roll twice and choose the result you want.
LCKY| Lucky| No matter what horrible situations you end up in, you always seem to make it out unscathed. When you suffer a critical injury, you get to re-roll the dice and choose the result that you prefer.
MEAN| Meanicing| You have a scary physical presence that makes it easy to intimidate people. You can roll for Persuasion using Strength instead of Empathy when you threaten someone.
MERC| Merciless| You can perform a coup de grace without rolling for Empathy.
BARD| Musician| You get a +1 modifier to all Persuasion rolls in situations where singing or playing an instrument is helpful.
MULE| Pack Mule| Your carry limit is increased by +2.
QUIK| Quick Draw| You can draw your weapon so quickly it doesn’t cost you an action.
RECK| Reckless| You can push any skill roll based on Agility twice, not just once like other characters.
SCND| Second Wind| When you are broken, you can get back on your feet immediately. Roll for Stamina. You cannot push the roll. For every success you roll, you get one point of Health or Resolve back (or attribute point, if using attribute damage). You can only use this specialty once while broken, and it has no effect against critical injuries.
SNPR| Sniper| You get a +1 modifier to Marksmanship rolls when firing a single shot (not full auto) at Long range or more, from a hidden position.
TUGH| Tough| Your maximum Health score is increased by 1. You can take this specialty up to three times.
GRIT| True Grit| You can push any skill roll based on Strength twice, not just once like other characters.
